# 🌱 HaciendaOps – Field guide system

**HaciendaOps** is a documentation-first knowledge system supporting sustainable agriculture and ecotourism teams in rural Nicaragua. Originally designed as a Flask API, this project now focuses on structured field knowledge, Kaizen workflows, and educational integration.

## 🧭 Field guide overview

This repository includes a Markdown-based training and operations guide used by rural teams and students to support sustainable farming and eco-projects across 2,000+ manzanas of land.

**API resources include:**

- `plant.md` – Medicinal, aromatic, and food crops
- `animal.md` – Livestock specs (e.g., Pelibuey goats)
- `tool.md` – Equipment profiles + safety/Kaizen notes
- `overview.md` – How to use the Field Guide system

## 🎓 Educational use case

This project was restructured as part of a university-level documentation course to demonstrate:

- Multi-layered documentation design
- Integration of field, operational, and legal insights
- Modular growth from docs to API → automation

## 📂 Example use flow

1. A worker scans a QR code at a planting site.
2. They reference the relevant `plant.md` entry for care instructions.
3. If a better method is discovered, they log a Kaizen proposal.
4. Once approved, the `docs/` folder is updated with the new best practice.
