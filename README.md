# 🌱 HaciendaOps – Field guide system

**HaciendaOps** is a REST API knowledge management system supporting sustainable agriculture and ecotourism teams in rural Nicaragua. This project focuses on structured field knowledge, [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) workflows, and educational integration.

## 🧭 Field guide overview

This repository includes a Markdown-based training and operations guide used by rural teams and students to support sustainable farming and eco-projects across 2,000+ manzanas (approximately 1.74 acres) of land.

**API resources include:**

- `plant.md` – Medicinal, aromatic, and food crops
- `animal.md` – Livestock specifications
- `tool.md` – Equipment profiles + safety/Kaizen notes
- `overview.md` – How to use the Field guide system

For information about this API and these resources, see the [HaciendaOps field guide overview](https://lyerdev.github.io/HaciendaOps/) and the [HaciendaOps quickstart guide](https://lyerdev.github.io/HaciendaOps/quickstart.html).

## 📂 Example workflow

1. A worker scans a QR code at a planting site.
2. They reference the relevant `plant.md` entry for care instructions.
3. If a better method is discovered, they modify a resource as necessary.
4. Once approved, the `docs/` folder is updated with the new best practice.
