# HaciendaOps field guide (HFG)

The HaciendaOps field guide is a lightweight resource for field workers and new hires. It contains trusted information about plant species, animal traits, and tool usage. By using an API inspired by a traditional to-do list, small farms can simplify their agricultural responsibilities with task automation.

## What is the HaciendaOps field guide?

This REST API is a tool that allows small farms and agricultural teams to track ongoing tasks and support both fieldwork and trading activities.

Farmers can also record produce-to-market steps and retrieve their daily priorities or task updates with ease. By combining
the task management features of the API along with the record keeping features of monitoring animal species on the farm,
the entire ecosystem can be adequately tracked.
