# HaciendaOps quickstart guide

After reading the [Overview](./docs/overview.md) topic, you can review the existing API reference materials and learn how certain operations
work with the tutorials found in the documentation for this API.

## API reference docs

These topics offer in-depth descriptions of the resources available to configure while workers are in the field.

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when referring to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service but when the API is running locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is commonly `http://localhost:3000`.

* [task resource](api/task.md)
* [tool resource](api/tool.md)
